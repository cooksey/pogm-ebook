plays during the last few years I may mention that the first act of <i>The
Tents of the Arabs</i> was written on September 3rd, and the second act on
September 8th, 1910.</p>

January 29th, and the third act on February 2nd and 3rd, 1911. <i>A Night
at an Inn</i> was written on January 17th, 1912, and <i>The Queen's Enemies</i>
