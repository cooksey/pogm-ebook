<h3 id="id00019">Act I</h3>

<p id="id00020">Time: About the time of the decadence in Babylon.</p>

<h5 id="id00021">Scene: The jungle city of Thek in the reign of King Karnos.</h5>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> You know that my lineage is almost divine.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> My father's sword was so terrible that he had to hide it with a cloak.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> He probably did that because there were no jewels in the scabbard.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> There were emeralds in it that outstared the sea.</p>

<p id="id00030">*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> Now I must leave you here and go down among the shops for I have not
changed my hair since we came to Thek.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Have you not brought that from Barbul-el-Sharnak?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> It was not necessary. The King would not take his court where they
could not obtain necessities.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> May I go with your Sincerity?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> Indeed, Princely Lady, I shall be glad of your company.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> [To
<span class="character-name">Ludibras</span>] I wish to see the other palaces
in Thek, [To <span class="character-name">Tharmia</span>]
then we can go on beyond the walls to see what princes live in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> It will be delightful.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Exeunt <span
class="character-name">Tharmia</span> and <span class="character-name">Arolind</span>]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Well, we are here in Thek.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> How lucky we are that the King has come to Thek. I feared he would
never come.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> It is a most fair city.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> When he tarried year after year in monstrous Barbul-el-Sharnak, I
feared that I would see the sun rise never more in the windy glorious
country. I feared we should live always in Barbul-el-Sharnak and be
buried among houses.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> It is mountainous with houses: there are no flowers there. I wonder how
the winds come into it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> Ah. Do you know that it is I that brought him here at last? I gave him
orchids from a far country. At last he noticed them. &ldquo;Those are good
flowers,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They come from Thek,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thek is purple with
them. It seems purple far out on the sand to the camel men.&rdquo; Then…</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> No, it was not you brought him. He saw a butterfly once in
Barbul-el-Sharnak. There had not been one there for seven years. It
was lucky for us that it lived; I used to send for hundreds, but they
all died but that one when they came to Barbul-el-Sharnak. The King
saw it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> It was since then that he noticed my purple orchids.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Something changed in his mind when he saw the butterfly. He became
quite different. He would not have noticed a flower but for that.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> He came to Thek in order to see the orchids.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Come, come. We are here. Nothing else matters.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> Yes, we are here. How beautiful are the orchids.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> What a beautiful thing the air is in the morning. I stand up very early
and breathe it from my casement; not in order to nourish my body, you
understand, but because it is the wild, sweet air of Thek.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> Yes, it is wonderful rising up in the morning. It seems all fresh from
the fields.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> It took us two days to ride out of Bar-el-Sharnak. Do you remember how
men stared at our camels? No one had gone away from the city for years.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> I think it is not easy to leave a great city. It seems to grow thicker
around you, and you forget the fields.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span>
<span class="character-action">[looking off]</span> The jungle is like a sea lying there below us. The orchids that blaze
on it are like Tyrian ships, all rich with purple of that wonderful
fish; they have even dyed their sails with it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> They are not like ships because they do not move. They are like… They
are like no tangible thing in all the world. They are like faint,
beautiful songs of an unseen singer; they are like temptations to some
unknown sin. They make me think of the tigers that slip through the
gloom below them.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Enter Harpagas and a Noble of the Court, with spears and leather belts.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Where are you going?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Harpagas:</span> We are going hunting.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Hunting! How beautiful!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Harpagas:</span> A little street goes down from the palace door; the other end of it
touches the very jungle.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> O, heavenly city of Thek.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Have you ever before gone hunting?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Harpagas:</span> No; I have dreamed of it. In Barbul-el-Sharnak I nearly forgot my
dream.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> Man was not made for cities. I did not know this once.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> I will come with you.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> I will come with you, too. We will go down by the little street, and
there will be the jungle. I will fetch a spear as we go.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> What shall we hunt in the jungle?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Harpagas:</span> They say there are kroot and abbax; and tigers, some say, have been
heard of.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Noble:</span> We must never go back to Barbul-el-Sharnak again.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ichtharion:</span> You may rely on us.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ludibras:</span> We shall keep the King in Thek.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Exeunt, leaving two sentries standing beside the throne.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> They are all very glad to be in Thek. I, too, am glad.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">2nd Sentry:</span> It is a very little city. Two hundred of these cities would not
build Barbul-el-Sharnak.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> No. But it is a finer palace, and Barbul-el-Sharnak is the centre of
the world; men have drawn together there.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">2nd Sentry:</span> I did not know there was a palace like this outside Barbul-el-Sharnak.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> It was built in the days of the forefathers. They built palaces in
those days.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">2nd Sentry:</span> They must be in the jungle by now. It is quite close. How glad they
were to go.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> Yes, they were glad. Men do not hunt for tigers in Barbul-el-Sharnak.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Enter Tharmia and Arolind weeping.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> Barbul-el-Sharnak, Barbul-el-Sharnak. O why did the King leave Barbul-el-Sharnak?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> Barbul-el-Sharnak. Its streets were all of agate.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> And there were shops where one bought beautiful hair.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> Nothing. What did you say?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> I said nothing. I thought you spoke.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Carolyx:</span> It may be better for my husband to persuade him, for he was ever
opposed to his coming to Thek.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> <span

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Arolind:</span> No. It will be better for our husbands to arrange it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Carolyx:</span> I myself have some influence with the Queen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> It is of no use. Her nerves are all a-quiver. She weeps if you speak

they have killed a beast. All four of the men are bringing it on two

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharmia:</span> I do not know. It seems to have barbed horns.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> He only does what Ichtharion and Ludibras persuade him. He does not
listen to the Queen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">2nd Sentry:</span> The Queen is mad.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">1st Sentry:</span> She is not mad but she has a curious sickness, she is always frightened
though there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">2nd Sentry:</span> That would be a dreadful sickness; one would fear that the roof might
fall on one from above or the earth break in pieces beneath. I would
rather be mad than to fear things like that.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> Why, what is
it then?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> I do not quite
know. But you know how I have ever feared the gods. The gods are going to do
some dreadful thing.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> Believe me;
the gods do nothing nowadays.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> You have indeed
been very good to me. It seems a little while since the camels came to
Argun-Zeerith by the iris marshes, the camels with the gold-hung palanquin,
and the bells above their heads, high up in the air, the silver bridal
bells. It seems a very little while ago. I did not know how swift the end
would come.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> What end? To
whom is the end coming?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> Do not be
troubled. We should not let Fate trouble us. The World and its daily cares,
ah, they are frightful: but Fate—I smile at Fate.  Fate cannot hurt us if we
smile at it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> What end do
you say is coming?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> I do not
know. Something that has been shall soon be no more.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> No, no. Look
upon Thek. It is built of rock and our palace is all of marble. Time has not
scratched it with six centuries. Six tearing centuries with all their
claws. We are throned on gold and founded upon marble. Death will some day
find me, indeed, but I am young. Sire after sire of mine has died in
Barbul-el-Sharnak or in Thek, but has left our dynasty laughing sheer in the
face of Time from over these age-old walls.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> Say farewell to me
now, lest something happen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> No, no, we
will not say unhappy things.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Executioner:</span> The sun has set.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King Karnos:</span> Not yet. The
jungle hides it. It is not yet set. Look at the beautiful light upon the
orchids. For how long they have flashed their purple on the gleaming walls of
Thek. For how long they will flash there on our immortal palace, immortal in
marble and immortal in song. Ah, how the colour changes.</p>
