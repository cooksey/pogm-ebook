<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> And how much longer will he keep us here?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> We&rsquo;ve been here three days.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> And &rsquo;aven't seen a soul.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> And a pretty penny it cost us when he rented the pub.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> &rsquo;Ow long did &rsquo;e rent the pub for?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> You never know with him.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> It&rsquo;s lonely enough.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> &rsquo;Ow long did you rent the pub for, Toffy?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Yet &rsquo;e&rsquo;s clever, no mistake.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Those clever ones are the beggars to make a muddle. Their plans are
clever enough, but they don&rsquo;t work, and then they make a mess of
things much worse than you or me.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Ah</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I don&rsquo;t like this place.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Why not?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I don&rsquo;t like the looks of it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> He&rsquo;s keeping us here because those niggers can&rsquo;t find us. The three
heathen priests what was looking for us so. But we want to go and sell
our ruby soon.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> There&rsquo;s no sense in it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Why not, Albert?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Because I gave those black devils the slip in Hull.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> You give &rsquo;em the slip, Albert?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> The slip, all three of them. The fellows with the gold spots on their
foreheads. I had the ruby then, and I give them the slip in Hull.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> How did you do it, Albert?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> I had the ruby and they were following me….</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Who told them you had the ruby? You didn&rsquo;t show it?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> No…. But they kind of know.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> They kind of know, Albert?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Yes, they know if you&rsquo;ve got it. Well, they sort of mouched after me,
and I tells a policeman and he says, O they were only three poor
niggers and they wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me. Ugh! When I thought of what they
did in Malta to poor old Jim.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Yes, and to George in Bombay before we started.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Ugh!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Why didn&rsquo;t you give &rsquo;em in charge?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> What about the ruby, Bill?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Ah!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Well, I did better than that. I walks up and down through Hull. I
walks slow enough. And then I turns a corner and I runs. I never sees
a corner but I turns it. But sometimes I let a corner pass just to
fool them. I twists about like a hare. Then I sits down and waits. No
priests.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> What?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> No heathen black devils with gold spots on their face. I give &rsquo;em the
slip.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Well done, Albert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> <span
class="character-action">[after a sigh of content]</span> Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> &rsquo;Cause &rsquo;e won't let you speak. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s got
&rsquo;is plans and &rsquo;e thinks we&rsquo;re silly folk. Things
must be done &rsquo;is way. And all the time I&rsquo;ve give &rsquo;em
the slip. Might &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad one of them crooked knives in him before
now but for me who give &rsquo;em the slip in Hull.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Well done, Albert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Do you hear that, Toffy? Albert has give &rsquo;em the slip.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Yes, I hear.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Well, what do you say to that?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> O… Well done, Albert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> And what a&rsquo; you going to do?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Going to wait.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Don&rsquo;t seem to know what &rsquo;e&rsquo;s waiting for.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> It&rsquo;s a nasty place.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> It&rsquo;s getting silly, Bill. Our money&rsquo;s gone and we want to sell the
ruby. Let&rsquo;s get on to a town.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> But &rsquo;e won&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Then we&rsquo;ll leave him.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> We&rsquo;ll be all right if we keep away from Hull.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> We&rsquo;ll go to London.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> But &rsquo;e must &rsquo;ave &rsquo;is share.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> All
right. Only let&rsquo;s go. <span class="character-action">[to <span class="character-name">the Toff</span>]</span> We&rsquo;re going, do you hear? Give
us the ruby.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Certainly.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[He gives them a ruby from his waistcoat pocket: it is the size
    of a small hen&rsquo;s egg.]</p>

<p class="scene-action">[He goes on reading his paper.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Come on, Sniggers.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Exeunt <span

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Good-bye, old man. We&rsquo;ll give you your fair share, but there&rsquo;s nothing
to do here, no girls, no halls, and we must sell the ruby.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> I&rsquo;m not a fool, Bill.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> No, no, of course not. Of course you ain&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ve helped us a
lot. Good-bye. You&rsquo;ll say good-bye?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Oh, yes. Good-bye.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Still reads paper. Exit <span class="character-name">Bill</span>.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> <span
class="character-action">[Out of breath.]</span> We&rsquo;ve come back, Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> So you have.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Toffy—How did they get here?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> They walked, of course.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> But it&rsquo;s eighty miles.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Did you know they were here, Toffy?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Expected them about now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Eighty miles.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Toffy, old man—what are we to do?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Ask Albert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> If they can do things like this there&rsquo;s no one can save us but you,
Toffy—I always knew you were a clever one. We won&rsquo;t be fools any
more. We&rsquo;ll obey you, Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> You&rsquo;re brave enough and strong enough. There isn&rsquo;t many that would
steal a ruby eye out of an idol&rsquo;s head, and such an idol as that was
to look at, and on such a night. You&rsquo;re brave enough, Bill. But you&rsquo;re
all three of you fools. Jim would have none of my plans and where&rsquo;s
Jim? And George. What did they do to him?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Don&rsquo;t, Toffy!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, then, your strength is no use to you. You want cleverness; or
they&rsquo;ll have you the way that they had George and Jim.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">All:</span> Ugh!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Those black priests would follow you round the world in circles, year
after year, till they got the idol&rsquo;s eye. And if we died with it
they&rsquo;d follow our grandchildren. That fool thinks he can escape men
like that by running round three streets in the town of Hull.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> God&rsquo;s truth, <i>you</i> &rsquo;aven't escaped them, because they&rsquo;re <i>&rsquo;ere</i>.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> So I supposed.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> You <i>supposed</i>?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Yes, I believe there&rsquo;s no announcement in the Society papers. But I
took this country seat especially to receive them. There&rsquo;s plenty of
room if you dig; it is pleasantly situated and what is most important
it is in a very quiet neighbourhood. So I am at home to them this
afternoon.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Well, you&rsquo;re a deep one.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> And remember you&rsquo;ve only my wits between you and death, and don&rsquo;t put
your futile plans against those of an educated gentleman.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> If you&rsquo;re a gentleman, why don&rsquo;t you go about among gentlemen instead
of the likes of us?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Because I was too clever for them as I am too clever for you.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Too clever for them?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> I never lost a game of cards in my life.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> You never lost a game?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Not when there was money on it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Well, well.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Have a game of poker?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">All:</span> No, thanks.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Then do as you&rsquo;re told.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> All right, Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I saw something just then. Hadn&rsquo;t we better draw the curtains?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> No.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> What?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Don&rsquo;t draw the curtains.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> O all right.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> But Toffy, they can see us. One doesn&rsquo;t let the enemy do that. I don&rsquo;t
see why….</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> No, of course you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> O all right, Toffy.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[All begin to pull out revolvers.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> <span

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Why not?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Because I don&rsquo;t want any noise at my party. We might get guests that
hadn&rsquo;t been invited. <i>Knives</i> are a different matter.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[All draw knives. <span

yet. <span class="character-name">Toffy</span> has already taken back his ruby.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> I think they&rsquo;re coming, Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Not yet.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> When will they come?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> When I am quite ready to receive them. Not before.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I should like to get this over.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Should you? Then we&rsquo;ll have them now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Now?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Yes. Listen to me. You shall do as you see me do. You will all pretend
to go out. I&rsquo;ll show you how. I&rsquo;ve got the ruby. When they see me
alone they will come for their idol&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> How can they tell like this which one of us has it?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> I confess I don&rsquo;t know, but they seem to.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> What will you do when they come in?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> I shall do nothing.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> What?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> They will creep up behind me. Then my friends, Sniggers and Bill
and Albert, who gave them the slip, will do what they can.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> All right, Toffy. Trust us.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> If you&rsquo;re a little slow you will see enacted the cheerful spectacle
that accompanied the demise of Jim.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Don&rsquo;t, Toffy. We&rsquo;ll be there all right.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Very well. Now watch me.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[He goes past the windows to the inner door R.; he opens it
    inwards. Then under cover of the open door he slips down on his

    to re-enter in the same manner.]</p>

<p class="dialog-continued">Now, I shall sit with my back to the door. You go out one by one so

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> We&rsquo;ll have to sell it now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> That won&rsquo;t be easy. It&rsquo;s a pity it isn't small and we had half a
dozen. Hadn&rsquo;t the idol any other on him?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> No, he was green jade all over and only had this one eye. He had it in
the middle of his forehead, and was a long sight uglier than anything
else in the world.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I&rsquo;m sure we ought all to be very grateful to Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> And indeed we ought.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> If it hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave been for him——</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Yes, if it hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been for old Toffy….</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> He&rsquo;s a deep one.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, you see, I just have a knack of foreseeing things.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> I should think you did.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span>Why, I don&rsquo;t suppose anything happens that our Toff doesn&rsquo;t
foresee. Does it, Toffy?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, I don&rsquo;t think it does, Bill. I don&rsquo;t think it often does.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Life is no more than just a game of cards to our old Toff.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, we've taken these fellows&rsquo; trick.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> <span
class="character-action">[going to the window]</span> It wouldn&rsquo;t do for any one to see them.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> O nobody will come this way. We&rsquo;re all alone on a moor.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Where will we put them?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Bury them in the cellar, but there&rsquo;s no hurry.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> And what then, Toffy?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Why, then we&rsquo;ll go to London and upset the ruby business. We&rsquo;ll have
really come through this job very nicely.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> I think the first thing we ought to do is give a little supper to
old Toffy. We&rsquo;ll bury these fellows to-night.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Yes, let&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> The very thing.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> And we&rsquo;ll all drink his health.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> Good old Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> He ought to have been a general or a premier.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[They get bottles from cupboard, etc.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, we&rsquo;ve earned our bit of a supper.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[They sit down.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> <span
class="character-action">[Glass in hand.]</span> Here&rsquo;s to old Toffy who guessed everything.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert and
Sniggers:</span> Good old Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Toffy who saved our lives and made our fortunes.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert and
Sniggers:</span> Hear. Hear.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> And here&rsquo;s to Bill who saved me twice to-night.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Couldn&rsquo;t have done it but for your cleverness, Toffy.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Hear, hear. Hear, hear.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Albert:</span> He foresees everything.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> A speech, Toffy. A speech from our general.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">All:</span> Yes, a speech.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> A speech.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> Well, get me some water. This whiskey&rsquo;s too much for my head, and I
must keep it clear till our friends are safe in the cellar.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Water. Yes, of course. Get him some water, Sniggers.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> We don&rsquo;t use water here. Where shall I get it?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bill:</span> Outside in the garden.</p>

it, Toffy, I don&rsquo;t want it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> You shall have it, Toffy, you shall have it yourself, only say
Sniggers has no share in this &rsquo;ere ruby. Say it, Toffy, say it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> No, no. Only I don&rsquo;t want the ruby, Toffy….</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> No more nonsense, Sniggers, we&rsquo;re all in together in this, if one hangs
we all hang; but they won&rsquo;t outwit me. Besides, it&rsquo;s not a hanging
affair, they had their knives.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Sniggers:</span> Toffy, Toffy, I&rsquo;ve always treated you fair, Toffy. I was always one to

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">The Toff:</span> The honest truth in open court, barring the ruby. We were attacked.</p>
