    stage. Two Slaves appear with tapers on the steps. As they go down the
    steps, they light the torches that are clamped against the wall, with
    their tapers. Afterwards when they come to the temple they light the
    torches there till they are all lit. The two Slaves are <span

the Queen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharni:</span> Yes, that's the
Temple.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharrabas:</span> Surely a grim
place.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharni:</span> The banquet is
prepared. We light these torches, that is all.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Tharrabas:</span> Unto whom is
it holy?</p>

Nile once. I know not to whom it is holy now.</p>

left it?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> Ah. All is ready.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> No, no,
Illustrious Lady. Nothing is ready. Your raiment—we must fasten it here <span

<p class="scene-action">[She begins to titivate the <span

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> Ackazárpses,
Ackazárpses, I cannot <i>bear</i> to have enemies.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> Indeed,
Illustrious Lady, it is wrong that you should have enemies.  One so delicate,
so slender and withal so beautiful should never have a foe.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> If the gods could
understand they would never permit it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> I have
poured out dark wine to them, I have offered them fat, indeed, I have often
offered them savoury things. I have said: The Queen should not have enemies;
she is too delicate, too fair. But they will not understand.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> If they could see
my tears they would never permit such woes to be borne by one small woman. But
they only look at men and their horrible wars. Why must men slay one another
and make horrible war?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> I blame your
enemies, Illustrious Lady, more than the gods. Why should they trouble you who
are so fair and so easily hurt by their anger? It was but a little territory
you took from them. How much better to lose a little territory than to be
unmannerly and unkind.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> O speak not of the
territory. I know naught of these things. They say my Captains took it. How
should I know? O why will they be my enemies?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> You are most
fair to-night, Illustrious Lady.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> I must needs be
fair to-night.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> Indeed you
are most fair.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> A little more
perfume, Ackazárpses.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> I will tie
the coloured bow more evenly.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> O they will never
look at it. They will not know if it is orange or blue. I shall weep if they
do not look at it. It is a pretty bow.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> Calm
yourself, lady! They will be here soon.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> Indeed I think
they are very close to me now, for I feel myself trembling.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> You must not
tremble, Illustrious Lady; you must not tremble.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> They are such
terrible men, Ackazárpses.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> But you must
not tremble, for your raiment is now perfect; yet if you tremble, alas! who
may say how it will hang?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> They are such
huge, terrible men.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> O the
raiment, the raiment; you must not, you must not!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> O I cannot bear
it. I cannot bear it. There is Rhádamandáspes, that huge, fierce soldier, and
the terrible Priest of Horus, and… and… O I cannot see them, I cannot see
them.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> Lady, you
have invited them.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> O say I am ill,
say I am sick of a fever. Quick, quick, say I have some swift fever and cannot
see them.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Ackazárpses:</span> Illustrious
Lady——</p>

are here.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Queen:</span> O what shall we
do?… Set this bow higher upon my head so that it must be seen.</p>

so.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> For the last
time, Rhádamandáspes, consider. Even yet we may turn back.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> She had
no guards outside nor was there any hiding place for them. There was the empty
plain and the Nile only.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> Who knows what
she may have in this dark temple?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> It is
small and the stairway narrow; our friends are close behind us. We could hold
these steps with our swords against all her men.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> True. They are
narrow steps. Yet… Rhádamandáspes, I do not fear man or god or even woman, yet
when I saw the letter this woman sent bidding us banquet with her I felt that
it was not well that we should come.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> She said
that she would love us though we were her enemies.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> It is not
natural to love one's enemies.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> She is
much swayed by whims. They sway her as the winds in spring sway flowers—this
way and that. This is one of her whims.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> I do not trust
her whims.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> They name
you Zophérnes, giver of good counsel, therefore I will turn back because you
counsel it, though I would fain go down and banquet with this little playful
lady.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[They turn and mount.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> Believe me,
Rhádamandáspes, it is better. I think that if you had gone down these steps we
scarcely should have seen the sky again.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Rhádamandáspes:</span> Well,
well, we turn back, though I would fain have humoured the Queen&rsquo;s whim. But
look. The others come. We cannot turn back. There comes the Priest of Horus;
we must go to the banquet now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zophérnes:</span> So be it.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[They descend.]</p>

be circumspect. If she has men in there we return at once.</p>

me.</p>

have come.</p>
