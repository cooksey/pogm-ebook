<h5 id="id01648">Scene: Outside the gate of the city of Thalanna.</h5>

<p id="id01649">Time: Uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="act1">Act I</h3>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> By evening we shall be in the desert again.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> Then no more city for us for many weeks.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Ah!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> We shall see the lights come out, looking back from the camel-track;
that is the last we shall see of it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> We shall be in the desert then.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> The old angry desert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> How cunningly the Desert hides his wells. You would say he had an
enmity with man. He does not welcome you as the cities do.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> He <i>has</i> an enmity. I hate the desert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> I think there is nothing in the world so beautiful as cities.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> Cities are beautiful things.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> I think they are loveliest a little after dawn when night falls off
from the houses. They draw it away from them slowly and let it fall
like a cloak and stand quite naked in their beauty to shine in some
broad river; and the light comes up and kisses them on the forehead. I
think they are loveliest then. The voices of men and women begin to
arise in the streets, scarce audible, one by one, till a slow loud
murmur arises and all the voices are one. I often think the city
speaks to me then: she says in that voice of hers, &ldquo;Aoob, Aoob, who
one of these days shall die, I am not earthly, I have been always, I
shall not die.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> I do not think that cities are loveliest at dawn. We can see dawn in
the desert any day. I think they are loveliest just when the sun is
set and a dusk steals along the narrower streets, a kind of mystery in
which we can see cloaked figures and yet not quite discern whose
figures they be. And just when it would be dark, and out in the desert
there would be nothing to see but a black horizon and a black sky on
top of it, just then the swinging lanterns are lighted up and lights
come out in windows one by one and all the colours of the raiments
change. Then a woman perhaps will slip from a little door and go away
up the street into the night, and a man perhaps will steal by with a
dagger for some old quarrel's sake, and Skarmi will light up his house
to sell brandy all night long, and men will sit on benches outside his
door playing skabash by the glare of a small green lantern, while they
light great bubbling pipes and smoke nargroob. O, it is all very good
to watch. And I like to think as I smoke and see these things that
somewhere, far away, the desert has put up a huge red cloud like a
wing so that all the Arabs know that next day the Siroc will blow, the
accursed breath of Eblis the father of Satan.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Yes, it is pleasant to think of the Siroc when one is safe in a city,
but I do not like to think about it now, for before the day is out we
will be taking pilgrims to Mecca, and who ever prophesied or knew by
wit what the desert had in store? Going into the desert is like
throwing bone after bone to a dog, some he will catch and some of them
he will drop. He may catch our bones, or we may go by and come to
gleaming Mecca. O-ho, I would I were a merchant with a little booth in
a frequented street to sit all day and barter.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> Aye, it is easier to cheat some lord coming to buy silk and ornaments
in a city than to cheat death in the desert. Oh, the desert, the
desert, I love the beautiful cities and I hate the desert.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> <span
class="character-action">[pointing off L]</span> Who is that?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> What? There by the desert&rsquo;s edge where the camels are?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Yes, who is it?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> He is staring across the desert the way that the camels go. They say
that the King goes down to the edge of the desert and often stares
across it. He stands there for a long time of an evening looking
towards Mecca.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Of what use is it to the King to look towards Mecca? He cannot go to
Mecca. He cannot go into the desert for one day. Messengers would run
after him and cry his name and bring him back to the council-hall or
to the chamber of judgments. If they could not find him their heads
would be struck off and put high up upon some windy roof: the judges
would point at them and say, &ldquo;They see better there!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> No, the King cannot go away into the desert. If God were to make me
King I would go down to the edge of the desert once, and I would shake
the sand out of my turban and out of my beard and then I would never
look at the desert again. Greedy and parched old parent of thousands
of devils! He might cover the wells with sand, and blow with his
Siroc, year after year and century after century, and never earn one
of my curses—if God made me King.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> They say you are like the King.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> Yes, I <i>am</i> like the King. Because his father disguised himself as a
camel-driver and came through our villages. I often say to myself,
&ldquo;God is just. And if I could disguise myself as the King and drive him
out to be a camel-driver, that would please God for He is just.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> If you did this God would say, &ldquo;Look at Bel-Narb, whom I made to be a
camel-driver and who has forgotten this.&rdquo; And then he would forget
you, Bel-Narb.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> Who knows what God would say?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> Who knows? His ways are wonderful.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Bel-Narb:</span> I would not do this thing, Aoob. I would not do it. It is only what I
say to myself as I smoke, or at night out in the desert. I say to
myself, &ldquo;Bel-Narb is King in Thalanna.&rdquo; And then I say, &ldquo;Chamberlain,
bring Skarmi here with his brandy and his lanterns and boards to play
skabash, and let all the town come and drink before the palace and
magnify my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Pilgrims:</span> <span

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Aoob:</span> The camels are rising. The caravan starts for Mecca. Farewell,
beautiful city.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Exeunt Bel-Narb and Aoob.]</p>

<p class="scene-action">[The <span class="character-name">King</span>
enters through the great door crowned. He sits upon the step.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> A crown should not be worn upon the head. A sceptre should not be
carried in Kings&rsquo; hands. But a crown should be wrought into a golden
chain, and a sceptre driven stake-wise into the ground so that a King
may be chained to it by the ankle. Then he would know that he might
not stray away into the beautiful desert and might never see the palm
trees by the wells. O Thalanna, Thalanna, how I hate this city with
its narrow, narrow ways, and evening after evening drunken men playing
skabash in the scandalous gambling house of that old scoundrel Skarmi.
O that I might marry the child of some unkingly house that generation
to generation had never known a city, and that we might ride from here
down the long track through the desert, always we two alone till we
came to the tents of the Arabs. And the crown—some foolish, greedy
man should be given it to his sorrow. And all this may not be, for a
King is yet a King.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Enter <span class="character-name">Chamberlain</span> through door.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Well, my lord Chamberlain, have you <i>more</i> work for me to do?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Yes, there is much to do.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I had hoped for freedom this evening, for the faces of the camels are
towards Mecca, and I would see the caravans move off into the desert
where I may not go.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> There is very much for your Majesty to do. Iktra has revolted.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Where is Iktra?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> It is a little country tributary to your Majesty, beyond Zebdarlon, up
among the hills.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Almost, had it not been for this, almost I had asked you to let me go
away among the camel-drivers to golden Mecca. I have done the work of
a King now for five years and listened to my councilors, and all the
while the desert called to me; he said, &ldquo;Come to the tents of my
children, to the tents of my children!&rdquo; And all the while I dwelt
among these walls.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> If your majesty left the city now——</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I will not, we must raise an army to punish the men of Iktra.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty will appoint the commanders by name. A tribe of your
Majesty&rsquo;s fighting men must be summoned from Agrarva and another from
Coloono, the jungle city, as well as one from Mirsk. This must be done
by warrants sealed by your hand. Your Majesty&rsquo;s advisers await you in
the council-hall.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> The sun is very low. Why have the caravans not started yet?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> I do not know. And then your Majesty——</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> <span
class="character-action">[laying his hand on the <span
class="character-name">Chamberlain</span>&rsquo;s arm]</span> Look, look! It is the shadows of the camels moving towards Mecca. How
silently they slip over the ground, beautiful shadows. Soon they are
out in the desert flat on the golden sands. And then the sun will set
and they will be one with night.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> If your Majesty has time for such things there are the camels
themselves.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> No, no, I do not wish to watch the camels. They can never take me out
to the beautiful desert to be free forever from cities. Here I must
stay to do the work of a King. Only my dreams can go, and the shadows
of the camels carry them, to find peace by the tents of the Arabs.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Will your Majesty now come to the council-hall?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Yes, yes, I come.</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Voices off: "Ho-<i>Yo!</i> Ho-<i>Yay!</i> …Ho-<i>Yo!</i> Ho-<i>Yay!</i>"]</p>

<p class="dialog-continued">Now the whole caravan has started. Hark to the drivers of the
baggage-camels. They will run behind them for the first ten miles, and
tomorrow they will mount them. They will be out of sight of Thalanna
then, and the desert will lie all round them with sunlight falling on
its golden smiles. And a new look will come into their faces. I am
sure that the desert whispers to them by night saying, &ldquo;Be at peace,
my children, at peace, my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="scene-action">[Meanwhile the <span class="character-name">Chamberlain</span> has opened the door
    for the <span class="character-name">King</span> and is waiting there bowing, with his hand resolutely on the opened
    door.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty will come to the council-hall?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Yes, I will come. Had it not been for Iktra I might have gone away and
lived in the golden desert for a year, and seen holy Mecca.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Perhaps your Majesty might have gone had it not been for Iktra.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> My curse
upon Iktra! <span class="character-action">[He goes through the doorway.]</span></p>

<p class="scene-action">[As they stand in doorway enter <span class="character-name">Zabra</span> R.]</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> Your Majesty.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> O-ho. More work for an unhappy King.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> Iktra is pacified.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Is pacified?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> It happened suddenly. The men of Iktra met with a few of your Majesty&rsquo;s
fighting men and an arrow chanced to kill the leader of the revolt, and
therefore the mob fled away although they were many, and they have all
cried for three hours, &ldquo;Great is the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I will even yet see Mecca and the dreamed-of tents of the Arabs. I
will go down now into the golden sands, I——</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty——</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> In a few years I will return to you.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty, it cannot be. We could not govern the people for more
than a year. They would say, &ldquo;The King is dead, the King——&rdquo;</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Then I will return in a year. In one year only.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> It is a long time, your Majesty.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I will return at noon a year from to-day.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> But, your Majesty, a princess is being sent for from Tharba.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I thought one was coming from Karshish.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> It has been thought more advisable that your Majesty should wed in
Tharba. The passes across the mountains belong to the King of Tharba
and he has great traffic with Sharan and the Isles.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Let it be as you will.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> But, your Majesty, the ambassadors start this week; the princess will
be here in three months&rsquo; time.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Let her come in a year and a day.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Your Majesty!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Farewell, I
am in haste. I go to make ready for the desert. <span class="character-action">[Exit
through door still speaking.]</span> The olden, golden mother of happy men.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span>
<span class="character-action">[to <span
class="character-name">Zabra</span>]</span> One from whom God had not withheld all wisdom would not have given
that message to our crazy young King.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> But it must be known. Many things might happen if it were not known at
once.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> I knew it this morning. He is off to the desert now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> That is evil indeed; but we can lure him back.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Perhaps not for many days.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> The King&rsquo;s favour is like gold.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> It is like much gold. Who are the Arabs that the King&rsquo;s favour should
be cast among them? The walls of their houses are canvas. Even the
common snail has a finer wall to his house.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> O, it is most evil. Alas that I told him this! We shall be poor men.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> No one will give us gold for many days.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> Yet you will govern Thalanna while he is away. You can increase the
taxes of the merchants and the tribute of the men that till the
fields.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> They will only pay taxes and tribute to the King, who gives of his
bounty to just and upright men when he is in Thalanna. But while he is
away the surfeit of his wealth will go to unjust men and to men whose
beards are unclean and who fear not God.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> We shall indeed be poor.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> A little gold perhaps from evil-doers for justice. Or a little money
to decide the dispute of some righteous wealthy man; but no more till
the King returns, whom God prosper.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> God increase him. Will you yet try to detain him?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> No. When he comes by with his retinue and escort I will walk beside
his horse and tell him that a progress through the desert will well
impress the Arabs with his splendour and turn their hearts towards
him. And I will speak privily to some captain at the rear of the
escort and he shall afterwards speak to the chief commander that he
may lose the camel-track in a few days&rsquo; time and take the King and his
followers to wander in the desert and so return by chance to Thalanna
again. And it may yet be well with us. We will wait here till they
come by.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> Will the chief commander do this thing certainly?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Yes, he will be one Thakbar, a poor man and a righteous.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> But if he be not Thakbar but some greedy man who demands more gold
than we would give to Thakbar?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Why, then we must give him even what he demands, and God will punish
his greed.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> He must come past us here.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> Yes, he must come this way. He will summon the cavalry from the
Saloia Samang.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> It will be nearly dark before they can come.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Chamberlain:</span> No, he is in great haste. He will pass before sunset. He will make
them mount at once.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Zabra:</span> <span

than God that he has laughed at our praying?</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> We may not say that he is greater than God. Yet we prayed that our own
year might not pass away. God could not save it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Yes, yes. We prayed that prayer. All men would laugh at it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> The prayer was not laughable. Only he that is lord of the years is
obdurate. If a man prayed for life to a furious, merciless Sultan well
might the Sultan&rsquo;s slaves laugh. Yet it is not laughable to pray for
life.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Yes. I will call to him when the wind is from the desert and the
locusts are beaten against my obdurate walls. I will call to him more
when I cannot see the desert and cannot hear the wind of it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> He shall bring back our year to us that Time cannot destroy. Time
cannot slaughter it if Memory says no. It is reprieved, though
banished. We shall often see it though a little far off and all its
hours and days shall dance to us and go by one by one and come back
and dance again.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Why, that is true. They shall come back to us. I had thought that they
that work miracles whether in Heaven or Earth were unable to do one
thing. I thought that they could not bring back days again when once
they had fallen into the hands of Time.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> It is a trick that Memory can do. He comes up softly in the town or
the desert, wherever a few men are, like the strange dark conjurors
who sing to snakes, and he does his trick before them, and does it
again and again.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> We will often make him bring the old days back when you are gone to
your people and I am miserably wedded to the princess coming from
Tharba.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> They will come with sand on their feet from the golden, beautiful
desert; they will come with a long-gone sunset each one over his head.
Their lips will laugh with the olden evening voices.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> It is nearly noon. It is nearly noon. It is nearly noon.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Why, we part then.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> O, come into the city and be Queen there. I will send its princess
back again to Tharba. You shall be Queen in Thalanna.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> I go now back to my people. You will wed the princess from Tharba on
the morrow. You have said it. I have said it.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> O, that I had not given my word to return.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> A King&rsquo;s word is like a King&rsquo;s crown and a King&rsquo;s
sceptre and a King&rsquo;s throne. It is in fact a foolish thing, like a city.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I cannot break my word. But you can be Queen in Thalanna.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Thalanna will not have a gypsy for a Queen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I will make Thalanna have her for a Queen.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> You cannot make a gypsy live for a year in a city.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I knew of a gypsy that lived once in a city.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Not such a gypsy as I… come back to the tents of the Arabs.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> I cannot. I gave my word.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Kings have broken their words.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Not such a King as I.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> We have only that little child of man whose name is Memory.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Come. He shall bring back to us, before we part, one of those days
that were banished.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Let it be the first day. The day we met by the well when the camels
came to El-Lolith.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Our year lacked some few days. For my year began here. The camels were
some days out.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> You were riding a little wide of the caravan, upon the side of the
sunset. Your camel was swinging on with easy strides. But you were
tired.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> You had come to the well for water. At first I could see your eyes,
then the stars came out, and it grew dark and I only saw your shape,
and there was a little light about your hair: I do not know if it was
the light of the stars, I only knew that it shone.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> And then you spoke to me about the camels.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> Then I heard your voice. You did not say the things you would say now.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> Of course I did not.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> You did not say things in the same way even.</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">Eznarza:</span> How the hours come dancing back!</p>

<p class="dialog"><span class="character-tag">King:</span> No, no. Only their shadows. We went together then to Holy Mecca. We
dwelt alone in tents in the golden desert. We heard the wild free day
sing sings in his freedom, we heard the beautiful night wind. Nothing
remains of our year but desolate shadows. Memory whips them and they
will not dance.</p>
